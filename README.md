# Data Analysis of Rockbuster Online Movie Rental Using SQL
## Introduction
This is a data analysis project for an online video rental company (Rockbuster Stealth LLC) which plans to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. I have conducted the analysis using SQL in PostgreSQL and presented the results to the company's management board.

## Objective
Develop an online movie rental strategy for 2020.

Key questions to be answered are:
1. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? And where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
2. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
3. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
4. What was the average rental duration for all videos?

## Data
The data sets used in this analysis are fabricated and provided by Career Foundry. There are 15 Excel tables; The tables include actor, address, category, city, country, customer, film, film actor, film category, inventory, language, payment, rental, staff, and store. The data was checked, cleaned, manipulated and analysed using SQL. 

## Tool
The different tables were manipulated and analysed using PostgreSQL, an open-source, object-relational database system. The visualizations for the analysis were created and stored in Tableau Public and can be accessed via [visualizations in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kimsan.mak/viz/Rockbusteronlinemovierental/Story1?publish=yes).
