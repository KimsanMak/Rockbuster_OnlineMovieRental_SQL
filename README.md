# Data Analysis of Rockbuster Online Movie Rental Using SQL
## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Objective
Develop an online movie rental strategy for 2020.

Key questions to be answered are:
1. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? And where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
2. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
3. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
4. What was the average rental duration for all videos?

The data sets used in this analysis are fabricated and provided by Career Foundry. There are 15 Excel tables; The tables include actor, address, category, city, country, customer, film, film actor, film category, inventory, language, payment, rental, staff, and store. The data was checked, cleaned and manipulated before being used in the analysis. 

## Tool
The different tables were manipulated and analysed using PostgreSQL, an open-source, object-relational database system.

## Visualizations
